# GitHub Actions Dependency Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow for the daily property scraper was failing with:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement scrapy-selenium==0.4.2 
(from versions: 0.8.1.dev1, 0.8.3, 0.8.4, 0.8.5, 0.8.6, 0.8.7)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for scrapy-selenium==0.4.2
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Local Fix Applied**: The `scrapy-selenium==0.4.2` dependency was correctly removed from `requirements.txt` locally
2. **Repository Updated**: The changes were committed and pushed to GitHub
3. **GitHub Actions Cache**: GitHub Actions was potentially using cached dependencies or the old requirements file

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Verified Local Requirements
- ✅ Confirmed `requirements.txt` no longer contains `scrapy-selenium==0.4.2`
- ✅ Verified only necessary dependencies remain:
  ```
  scrapy>=2.13.3
  psycopg2-binary>=2.9.6
  requests>=2.31.0
  PyYAML>=6.0
  python-dotenv>=1.0.0
  selenium>=4.15.0
  ```

### 2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Added `pip cache purge` to clear any cached dependencies
- ✅ Added requirements.txt content verification step
- ✅ Updated workflow to force fresh dependency installation

### 3. Forced Workflow Refresh
- ✅ Committed and pushed changes to trigger new GitHub Actions run
- ✅ New workflow will use updated requirements.txt without cached dependencies

## 🚀 Expected Results
The next GitHub Actions run should:
1. **Display requirements.txt content** to verify correct file is being used
2. **Successfully install dependencies** without scrapy-selenium errors
3. **Complete daily scraping** with all enhanced features working

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Updated Workflow File: `.github/workflows/daily-scraper.yml`
```yaml
- name: Install Python dependencies
  run: |
    cd scraper
    echo "Checking requirements.txt content:"
    cat requirements.txt
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip cache purge
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Benefits:
- **Cache Clearing**: Ensures no old dependencies are cached
- **Verification**: Shows exactly what requirements file is being used
- **Reliability**: Forces fresh installation every time

## ✅ Resolution Status
- **Local Scraper**: ✅ Working (7 deals found in last test)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Fixed (scrapy-selenium removed)
- **GitHub Actions**: 🔄 Updated workflow pushed, next run should succeed
- **Enhanced Features**: ✅ All store enhancements active (URL extraction, street data, validation)

The daily property scraper should now run successfully both locally and in GitHub Actions! 🎉
