# Deployment Checklist

## Files Moved to Root:
✅ package.json (with vite dependency)
✅ vite.config.js
✅ index.html
✅ src/ directory
✅ public/ directory
✅ tailwind.config.js
✅ postcss.config.js
✅ tsconfig files

## Build Test:
✅ `npm install` successful
✅ `npm run build` successful
✅ dist/ directory created with assets

## Vercel Configuration:
✅ vercel.json updated for new structure
✅ API routes in /api directory
✅ Static build configured

## Ready for Deployment:
The project structure is now compatible with Vercel's expectations:
- Frontend files in root directory
- Build outputs to dist/
- API endpoints in /api/
- All dependencies properly configured

## Next Steps:
1. Commit changes to git
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Test both frontend and API endpoints
