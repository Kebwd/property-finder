## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### Phase 1: Start with Working Sites (This Week)
```bash
# Use your current working scraper
cd C:\Users\User\property-finder\scraper
python practical_property_scraper.py

# Results: 7+ properties extracted immediately
# Sources: NetEase, Sohu Focus, News sites
```

### Phase 2: Scale Up Regional Sites (Next Week)
```python
# Expand to more regional NetEase portals:
regional_sites = [
    'http://sh.house.163.com/',  # Shanghai
    'http://sz.house.163.com/',  # Shenzhen
    'http://fs.house.163.com/',  # Foshan
    'http://dg.house.163.com/',  # Dongguan
    # Add your target cities
]
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (As Needed)
```python
# For blocked sites, use:
from advanced_property_scraper import AdvancedPropertyScraper
scraper = AdvancedPropertyScraper(use_stealth=True)
properties = scraper.scrape_regional_sites('guangzhou')
```

## 💡 **HYBRID APPROACH - BEST RESULTS**

### Combine Multiple Sources:
1. **News Sites**: Market trends and price data
2. **Regional Portals**: Specific property listings  
3. **Government Data**: Official transaction records
4. **APIs**: Supplement with commercial data

### Example Implementation:
```python
# Daily data collection strategy
morning_scrape = news_sites()        # 10-20 properties
afternoon_scrape = regional_sites()  # 20-50 properties  
evening_api = rapidapi_supplement()  # 100+ properties

total_daily = morning + afternoon + evening  # 130-170 properties/day
```
