# Chinese Property Scraping Strategy Guide

## Current Situation Analysis
After testing both Lianjia and 58.com, we've encountered the following challenges:

1. **Lianjia**: Advanced anti-bot detection with JavaScript challenges
2. **58.com**: CAPTCHA verification required (显示验证码页面)
3. **Most major sites**: Implementing increasingly sophisticated bot detection

## Recommended Solutions

### Approach 1: Use Residential Proxy Services
- **Service**: Bright Data, Oxylabs, or ProxyMesh
- **Benefit**: Real residential IPs that bypass geo-blocking
- **Cost**: ~$500-1000/month for reliable access
- **Success Rate**: 85-95%

### Approach 2: API-Based Property Data
- **Service**: RapidAPI Real Estate APIs
- **Providers**: Various Chinese property data providers
- **Benefit**: Structured, reliable data without scraping
- **Cost**: ~$200-500/month depending on volume

### Approach 3: Alternative Smaller Sites
- **Target**: Regional real estate portals
- **Examples**: Local government property transaction records
- **Benefit**: Less bot protection
- **Challenge**: Data formatting varies by region

### Approach 4: Mobile App API Reverse Engineering
- **Target**: Mobile app APIs (often less protected)
- **Tools**: mitmproxy, Charles Proxy
- **Benefit**: Direct access to JSON APIs
- **Complexity**: Higher technical requirements

## Immediate Practical Solution

Since you need property data quickly, I recommend:

### Option A: Use Public Data Sources
1. **Government Property Transaction Records**
   - Beijing: http://zjw.beijing.gov.cn/
   - Shanghai: http://www.fangdi.com.cn/
   - Shenzhen: http://www.szpl.gov.cn/

2. **Academic/Research APIs**
   - Some universities provide property research APIs
   - Often free for research purposes

### Option B: Hybrid Approach - Demo Data + Selective Real Scraping
1. Create realistic demo data for your cities
2. Focus scraping efforts on 1-2 less protected regional sites
3. Gradually expand as you find working sources

## Implementation Priority

Given the blocking we're experiencing, let's implement:

1. **Demo Data Generator** - Create realistic property data for all your cities
2. **Government Data Parser** - Parse public transaction records  
3. **Regional Site Scraper** - Target smaller, less protected sites
4. **API Integration Framework** - Ready for when you get API access

Would you like me to implement any of these approaches?
