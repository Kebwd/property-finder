# Enhanced Lianjia scraping approach with anti-bot measures
# This is more complex but necessary for Lianjia

enhanced_approach:
  # 1. Rotating Proxies
  proxy_rotation:
    - Use services like Bright Data, ScraperAPI, or ProxyMesh
    - Rotate IP addresses frequently
    - Use residential proxies instead of datacenter IPs
  
  # 2. Browser Fingerprinting
  browser_stealth:
    - Use undetected-chromedriver instead of regular Selenium
    - Randomize browser fingerprints
    - Mimic real user behavior (mouse movements, scrolling)
  
  # 3. Session Management
  session_handling:
    - Maintain session cookies
    - Handle login requirements
    - Implement CAPTCHA solving (2captcha, Anti-Captcha)
  
  # 4. Rate Limiting
  respectful_scraping:
    - Long delays between requests (5-10 seconds)
    - Random delays to avoid patterns
    - Limit concurrent requests to 1
  
  # 5. Alternative Data Sources
  easier_targets:
    - 58.com (less strict anti-bot)
    - Anjuke.com (alternative property site)
    - Fang.com (real estate portal)
    - Local government property databases

# Implementation would require:
additional_packages:
  - undetected-chromedriver
  - selenium-stealth  
  - fake-useragent
  - rotating-proxies
  - captcha-solver
